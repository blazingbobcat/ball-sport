 Ball sport game 

My game Ball Sport version 0.2a.  You are a black-and-white cartoon character juggling 3 balls until you drop one.  The third ball comes after 100 points.  How many points can you rack up before you drop a ball?  This version has a graphics update and should run more smoothly.  The game will be finalized soon after feedback is given.

This version made in Python 3.6.3 (64-bit) using pygame version 1.9.  Should be compatible with all OS's, but let me know if not compatible with yours.
