 Ball sport game 

                                                      Ball Sport Version 1.1
You are a black-and-white cartoon character juggling 3 balls until you drop one.  The third ball comes after 100 points.  How many points can you rack up before you drop a ball?  Instructions are on the screen before you begin playing.  This is a revision of the original version 1.0.  Some major bugs were resolved, and new features were added.

                                                            Features

-2-Player Mode!  Compete against a friend!
-Hi-Score system!  Records all your high scores from the game in a log!
-Realistic sound effects, like you've never heard before!
-Exciting juggling action just like in real life!

This version made in Python 3.6.3 (64-bit) using pygame version 1.9.  Should be compatible with all OS's.
