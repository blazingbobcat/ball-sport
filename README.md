 Ball sport game 

                                                      Ball Sport Version 0.3 Beta!
You are a black-and-white cartoon character juggling 3 balls until you drop one.  The third ball comes after 100 points.  How many points can you rack up before you drop a ball?  Instructions are on the screen before you begin playing.

                                                             New Features

-2-Player Mode!  Compete against a friend!  Just press '2' for 2 players!
-Hi-Score system!  Records all your high scores from the game in a log!  (Current hi-score is 160).
-Realistic sound effects, like you've never heard before!

This version made in Python 3.6.3 (64-bit) using pygame version 1.9.  Should be compatible with all OS's.
